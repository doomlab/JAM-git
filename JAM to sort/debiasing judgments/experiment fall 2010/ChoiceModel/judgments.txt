7. Application to associative judgments
*** rewrite choice axiom as v=P * sum(v)
*** or, more generally, v = c + sum(v) * P
*** Thus choice model predicts that judgments of associative strength
*** are a linear function of free association probabilities --
*** and that is the JAM function (Maki, 2007a, 2007b)
*** Summarize judgment data from Maki, 2007a, 2007b
*** Use search routines to recover FSG and BSG weighting values
*** as well as values of bias parameter for each experiment.
*** Discuss fit of model

Another way of expressing Eq. 1A is to solve for response strength, vi:
vi = sum(vj) pi :::: Eq. 5
Eq. 5 makes it clear that response strength for items in the choice set is a linear function of response probability.
