Abstract

Introduction
1. General intro to association and its measurement
*** history -- Esper
*** from Galton
*** via Cramer's review
*** to Nelson et al. norms
2. Continuing importance of associative phenomena
2a. Association and modern computational approaches to cognition
*** e.g., Steyvers et al.
2b. Enduring theoretical issue - item vs. associative information
*** Buchler, Light, & Reder 2008
2c. Associative judgments as a microworld for metacognitive judgments
*** e.g., Koriat & Bjork
3. Association as choice
3a. Analogy between buying an automobile and selecting the strongest associate in a free association test
3b. Choice theory
*** Luce choice axiom
*** History???
*** Quantitative model (from Yellott, 1977)
3c. Similarity to Nelson-McEvoy-Dennis model
4. Preview of rest of paper
4a. Discovering theoretical means
4b. Application to reliability of free associations
4c. Application to associative judgments
4d. Application to rank order judgments
4e. Exploring associative combination
5. Discovering theoretical means
*** like Maki 2008
*** but using Luce choice axiom, P=v/sum(v)
*** where v=exp(a*u)
*** Use gradient descent to find u for each cue-response pair
6. Application to reliability of free associations
*** Because of distribution overlap, and random sampling
*** assumption, reliability is less than perfect.
*** meta-analysis of test-retest results from late 1960s
*** model predictions
*** possible sources of repeat rates at intervals < 1 year
7. Application to associative judgments
*** rewrite choice axiom as v=P * sum(v)
*** or, more generally, v = c + sum(v) * P
*** Thus choice model predicts that judgments of associative strength
*** are a linear function of free association probabilities --
*** and that is the JAM function (Maki, 2007a, 2007b)
*** Summarize judgment data from Maki, 2007a, 2007b
*** Use search routines to recover FSG and BSG weighting values
*** as well as values of bias parameter for each experiment.
*** Discuss fit of model
8. Application to rank order judgments
*** Because of overlap, like reliability, rank order judgments are 
*** less than perfect.
*** Illustrative experiment from Krimsky's summer RA-ship
*** Application of model
*** Weightings suggest different strategy for rank order judgments
*** (relying more on BSG than on FSG)
9. Exploring associative combination
*** Question:  are the weights determining the FSGxBSG interaction
*** susceptible to attentional control?
*** Debiasing experiment
*** Application of model -- debiasing reduces bias and does not 
*** influence associative weights
*** Implications for metacognitive views (Koriat & Bjork)
10. Conclusion
*** Recap
*** relation to other approaches -- e.g., PIER, Nelson-McEvoy-Dennis
*** metacognitive stuff (Koriat & Bjork)
*** Whiz-bang ending
