Erin,

In the sorted all the same and experimental groups tabs:
could you provide the N for the rightmost column?

16Éshould we exclude the people who left the final form blank?  I mean, I said like 8 times to do the form.  I don't know what why that group has such a bad split - they were all mixed together when I ran them.


MCO form 1 = control group sort 1 
mct form 2 = control group sort 2

msf = steak-sirlion, fawn first, experimental group
msi = steak-sirlion, insight first, experimental group
mif = sirlion-steak, fawn first, experimental groups
mii = sirlion-steak, insight first, experimental groups


- created total overalls and ran regressions - see pdf.  WHat other analyses do you want?

- presentation makes sense to me - as long as there's some connection between all the luce stuff and all our ideas.  I think when you talk there will be, it's just a bit blank at the moment.
